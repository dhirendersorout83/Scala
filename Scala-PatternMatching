DEFINE PATTERN:
we import Regex class:scala.util.matching.Regex to deifne new patter
or
use (.r) with pattern string

val mypatern = "(\d)".r
or
val numPattern = new Regex("[0-9]+")

create patter:
[] - define a range for num/char eg [0-9a-zA-Z] 
with NOt [^0-9a-zA-Z]
{} to mention no of iteration eg 2 digit no [0-9]{2} or (\d){2} or 0 or 2 time, more time {0,2} {0,} leave blank for more
() making group of character eg date "(\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d\d\d\d)"
